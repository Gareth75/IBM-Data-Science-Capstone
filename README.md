# IBM-Data-Science-Capstone
## This project is the final part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
## It is an exploration in to the success of Space X rockets
## In particular, the aim of the project to predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
## SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
## As a result, if the success of the first stage landing can be predicted, the cost of the launch can be estimated with more certainty.
## This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
